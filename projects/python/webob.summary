              FLAKE8 AUDIT REPORT
==============================================

Analyzing directory: ./

===== SECURITY (S) CRITICAL ISSUES =====
S101 Use of assert detected. The enclosed code will be removed when compiling to optimised byte code. - 2560
Statement looks unnecessary. -    5
S603 subprocess call - check for execution of untrusted input. -    2
S108 Probable insecure usage of temp file/directory. -    2
S324 Use of weak MD5 hash for security. Consider usedforsecurity=False -    1
S607 Starting a process with a partial executable path -    1
S404 Consider possible security implications associated with the subprocess module. -    1
S311 Standard pseudo-random generators are not suitable for security/cryptographic purposes. -    1

===== BUG RISKS (B) =====
B028 No explicit stacklevel argument found. The warn method from the warnings module uses a stacklevel of 1 by default. This will only show a stack trace for the line on which the warn method is called. It is therefore recommended to use a stacklevel of 2 or greater to provide more information to the user. -   33
B010 Do not call setattr with a constant attribute value, it is not any safer than normal property access. -    7
B015 Result of comparison is not used. This line doesn't do anything. Did you intend to prepend it with assert? -    5
B009 Do not call getattr with a constant attribute value, it is not any safer than normal property access. -    4
B036 Don't except `BaseException` unless you plan to re-raise it. -    3
B023 Function definition does not bind loop variable 'charset'. -    1

===== DOCSTRINGS (D) =====
D102 Missing docstring in public method - 1057
D103 Missing docstring in public function -  456
D400 First line should end with a period -  163
D202 No blank lines allowed after function docstring -  109
D101 Missing docstring in public class -   85
D105 Missing docstring in magic method -   83
D200 One-line docstring should fit on one line with quotes -   70
D205 1 blank line required between summary line and description -   67
D100 Missing docstring in public module -   40
D107 Missing docstring in __init__ -   34
D401 First line should be in imperative mood -   16
D401 First line should be in imperative mood; try rephrasing -   12
D209 Multi-line docstring closing quotes should be on a separate line -    5
D412 No blank lines allowed between a section header and its content -    4
D301 Use r""" if any backslashes in a docstring -    3
D403 First word of the first line should be properly capitalized -    2
D104 Missing docstring in public package -    1

===== PIE (P) =====
PIE781 You are assigning to a variable and then returning. Instead remove the assignment and return. -    8
PIE786 Use precise exception handlers. -    5

===== OTHER ISSUES =====
Remove the dict and pass the kwargs directly. -    5
Return boolean expressions directly instead of returning `True` and `False`. -    4
'pwd'    -    2
'seekrit' -    1
'sekrit!' -    1
Use isinstance for comparing types. -    1
'opaque-token' -    1
Considering using the builtin enum type. -    1
/ or custom schemes is often unexpected. -    1

Bug Risks (B):   53 issues
Docstrings (D): 2207 issues
Logging (G):    0 issues
